**What does puts do?**

`puts` outputs the content of your Ruby program on a new line. 

**What is an integer? What is a float?**

An integer is a number without a decimal point. A float is a number with a decimal point.

**What is the difference between float and integer divison?**

Float division returns answers to the decimal point. Integer division rounds down if the answer isn't a whole number - such as 11/2 == 5. Integer division can be used when the answer doesn't work as a fraction.

**How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?**

Ruby uses arithmetic operators: + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, and / for divison.

**What are strings? Why and when would you use them?**

Strings in Ruby are any characters (letters, numbers, etc) within quotation marks. Strings are used to output text, and to include method arguments using string interpolation.

**What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?**

Local variables are exclusive to the method in which they're constructed. They can't be accessed outside of that code.  *********

**How was this challenge? Did you get a good overview of the basics?**
