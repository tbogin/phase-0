# Your Solution Below

def valid_triangle?(a, b, c)
  return false if [a,b,c].include?(0)
  return true if [a,b,c].uniq.length == 1
  if a**2 + b**2 == c**2 || a**2 + c**2 == b**2 || c**2 + b**2 == a**2
    return true
  elsif a + b > c && a + c > b && c + b > a
    return true
  end
  false
end


=begin
In the my_solution.rb file:

Write a method valid_triangle? which takes as its input three non-negative numbers. It should return true if 
the three numbers could form the side lengths of a triangle and false otherwise.

The arguments don't correspond to specific sides. Don't worry about handling negative inputs â€” garbage in gets garbage out.

Note: When you see a method that has a ? in its name, that means the expected result is a boolean value. 
It should return true or false. Keep this in mind when working through later challenges or writing your own challenges.

For example,

valid_triangle?(0,0,0) # => false, because a triangle can't have 0-length sides

valid_triangle?(1,1,1) # => true, an equilateral triangle

valid_triangle?(3,4,5) # => true, a right triangle
valid_triangle?(4,3,5) # => true, the same right triangle
valid_triangle?(5,3,4) # => true, the same right triangle

valid_triangle?(10, 10, 100) #=> false, no such triangle exists
