// __________________________________________
// Refactored Solution

// What did you learn about adding functions to objects?
//I learned about adding functions outside the object itself by making the object global in scope

// How did you iterate over nested arrays in JavaScript?
//Similar to Ruby, I reached nested arrays by calling the associated array or key names until reaching the targeted array items

// Were there any new methods you were able to incorporate? If so, what were they and how did they work?
//




// __________________________________________
// Reflection

// What did you learn about iterating over nested objects in JavaScript?
  //I learned about scoping through objects in order to reach targeted values
  
// Were you able to find useful methods to help you with this?
  //We stuck with for in loops
  
// What concepts were solidified in the process of working through this challenge?
  //Reaching values within nested objects
