**What is my site's primary goal?**

My website is designed to showcase my ability as a web developer. It will feature my bio, resume, and relevant work.

**Interests of my target audience**

My target audience are potential employers. As they will be interested in my coding ability, my website will display my code in an eye-catching manner.

**What is the primary action the user should take when visiting my site?**

My website mainly exists to show my bio portfolio. My intended actions for visitors to my website are to read my bio, then click on my portfolio.

**What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?**

User experience and usability are not quite synonamous. User experience goes beyond usability (ease, efficiency), into psychology, information architecture, and principles of design.
Another is that UX design is never one size fits all. Every user is different, and the designer can only design based on how they believe most users will be respond to the website.

**What is user experience design, and why is it valuable?**

UX design is the practice of designing a website based on how users feel about interacting with a system. It takes into account aspects of websites such as ease of use, efficiency of performing tasks, and the perception of the site's value.

**Which part of the challenge did you find tedious?**

Creating website files is brand new to me. It was all interesting. Adapting my reflections into markdown can be a bit tedious.
