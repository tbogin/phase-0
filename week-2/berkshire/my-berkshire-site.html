<!--2.6 Reflection
What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was great to implement CodeAcademy tutorials into building a real website from scratch.

How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
Researching HTML5 elements was relatively stress-free, as the information is widely available, such as on W3Schools.

How did you do at keeping to best practices?
My pair and I were able to keep to HTML5 best practices when replicating Berkshire Hathaway's website.

What seems good and bad about HTML?
The Good: HTML is easy to learn, and simple to implement.
The Bad: Doing more than bare-bones work requires more complicated code, such as CSS and JavaScript.

What tricks do you have to remembering how to write HTML?
I'm a visual person, so I can picture much of an HTML document in my head.
