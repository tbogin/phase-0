Creating a GitHub repository & cloning it to your computer

1. On GitHub, click the + icon next to your avatar on the top right of the screen. Click the option to create a repository. 

2. Name your repository, and give it (optional) content. Click 'Create repository'

3. In your new repository, copy the URL provided. 

4. Open the command line (don't be intimidated by it!), and type 'git clone <URL>' and press enter. Now your repository can be edited on your computer.

Open source is source code accessible for the general public to copy and modify for themselves.

Open source is great for replicable templates for things such as blogs, and for specialized projects, such as Wikipedia. It's obviously not useful for everything. 

Open source licesnes are important, as they legally allow open sourcing of code to take place.

The process of branching, modifying documents, and uploading them to GitHub via git commands was largely solidified for me in this challenge.
