## 1.1 Think About Time: Reflection

- Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?
  I learned about maintaining mindfulness, the neural benefits of meditation, the benefits of beginning large projects with small goals, and forming good habits in order to optimize one's work life

- What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?
  Time boxing is the practice of working for set periods of time before stopping work, whether or not it’s complete. At the end of each time box, the individual or team evaluates what they accomplished in order to set future productivity goals. I can use time boxing in Phase 0 to calibrate the time I’ll need to complete assignments.

- How do you manage your time currently?
  I manage my time by creating a schedule based on the estimated time I think my tasks will take. I try to set realistic goals on the time I’ll need to complete what needs to be done. I allow myself some leeway in order to reduce stress, and factor in unexpected events that can take up my time. I also give myself short breaks every 30-60 minutes, depending on the intensity of the task.

- Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?
  My strategy works when I’m realistic about how much I can achieve within a designated time. When I bite off more than I can chew, I take note of it, and adjust future checklists accordingly. Taking short breaks for decompression is necessary for me to maintain long term focus.

- Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?
  I plan on diving into DBC’s curriculum, but intend to walk away from my laptop for short periods in order to maintain focus, and to absorb information. I will schedule a bit more than 25 hours per week for DBC, as brand new concepts may take longer to learn than ones with which I’m more familiar.

- What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?
  For Phase 0, I plan on completing tasks roughly in listed order. I’ll try to complete multiple (perhaps 2-3) short - medium tasks each day, and give myself multiple days for the long tasks, such as learning the CLI. I also plan on frequently reviewing material from current and past weeks with notes & flashcards, and posing questions on Slack after or during challenges. I will take time boxing to heart, and evaluate the time I need for tasks of varying lengths, in order to better manage my time over the course of Phase 0.

## 1.2 The Command Line: Reflection

1. What is a shell? What is "bash?"
  A shell is the interface used to access and navigate a system’s files. Bash is a command language used within a shell.

2. What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
  The most challenging aspect of the CLI tutorial was not becoming discouraged by error messages, and generally adjusting to the new environment of the shell.

3. Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
  I’m having difficulty using pushd and popd, and I’m not sure why.

4. In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?
  The most important commands seem to be cd, mkdir, rmdir, rm, cp, pwd, and ls. These commands are essential for navigating the filesystem, and creating/maintaining paths without getting lost.

5. Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.
```
pwd: Print working directory – shows you which file you’re currently on.
ls – List – shows contents of the working directory.
mv – Move – renames a file.
cd – Change directory – moves you up and down the filepath.
../ - Moves you backward on the filepath.
touch – Creates an empty file when typed before a file name.
mkdir – Make directory – creates a new directory beneath the working directory.
less – Shows you a file.
rmdir – Remove directory – removes a specific directory from filepath.
rm – Removes files containing other files.
help – finds information on CLI commands.
```
